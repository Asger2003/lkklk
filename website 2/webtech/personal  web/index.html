<h3>ALCHEMIST - PAULO COELHO</h3>
<img src="img44.jpg" width="250" class="center-img" />
<ul type = "square">
<li>In the Prologue, the alchemist reads a story about Narcissus—a youth so fascinated by his own beautiful reflection that he falls into a lake and drowns. In this version of the story, the goddess of the forest encounters the lake in which Narcissus drowned. The lake is weeping, and the goddess assumes that the lake misses Narcissus’s beauty. However, the lake reveals that, actually, it’s weeping because it misses being able to admire its own beautiful reflection in Narcissus’s eyes. “What a lovely story,” the alchemist thinks.

In Part One of the novel, Santiago passes the night with his flock of sheep in an abandoned church. That night, he has a recurring dream. When he wakes, he looks forward to the village he will reach in four days where, the year before, he met a girl, the daughter of a merchant. Meeting her made him wish, for the first time in his life, that he could remain in one place. Santiago loves to travel, and became a shepherd, rather than a priest as his family had wanted, because his father told him that, among poor folk, only shepherds had the opportunity to travel.</li>

<h3>LOLITA - VLADIMIR NABOKOV</h3>
<img src="img66.jpg" width="360" class="center-img" />
<ul type = "square">
  <li> Lolita, a novel by Russian-American author Vladimir Nabokov, was published in 1955 in Paris. American publishing companies refused to publish the novel due to its scandalous plot, but the book was considered a classic almost instantly. In 1967, the novel was finally published in America and, since then, Lolita has appeared on several lists of the greatest English-language and American novels of all time. The novel blends genres, offering readers elements of romance, erotica, and mystery, and offers an unreliable first-person narrator in Humbert Humbert. Lolita has been made into two films, one directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1962 and another by Adrian Lyne in 1997. Additionally, several stage plays, ballets, and operas have also been based on the work. The novel’s reach even extends to the English language itself. Today, the term “lolita” is widely used to refer to a sexually precocious girl who is not a victim but a seductress, and it also is used to refer to a style of dress that emphasizes doll-like clothing that romanticizes girlhood. This guide uses the 50th anniversary edition of Lolita by Vintage.</li>

<img src="img88.jpg" width="360" class="center-img" />
<ul type = "square">
<li> To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel written by Harper Lee and originally published in 1960. The book is widely regarded as an American classic and, until recently, was the only novel Lee had published. To Kill a Mockingbird was inspired by events and observations that took place in Lee’s hometown. Set in the Great Depression, from 1932 to 1935, the novel is narrated by a young girl named Scout, whose coming-of-age experiences closely mirror Lee’s.</li>
